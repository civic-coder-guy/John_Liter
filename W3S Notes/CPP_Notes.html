<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>It is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performace applications.<br>
	It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.<br>
	It gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.<br>
	The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.<br>
	It is one of the world's most popular programming languages.<br>
	It can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.</br>
	It is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.<br>
	It is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.<br>
	As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.<br>
	C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax. The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.</p>
	
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
	<p>To get get started and using C++, I receommend following the steps at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_getstarted.asp">W3 Schools</a> to get getting started with writing C++.</p>
	
<h1>Syntax</h1>
	<p>Example breakdown<br>
	Line 1: <code id="ct">#include <iostream></code><br>
	Line 2: <code id="ct">using namespace std;</code><br>
	Line 3: <br>
	Line 4: <code id="kw">int </code> <code> main() {</code><br>
	Line 5: <code>std::</code> <code id="kw">cout</code> <code><<</code> <code>"Hello World!"</code> <code>;</code><br>
	Line 6: <code id="kw">return 0</code><code>;</code><br>
	Line 7: <code>}</code>
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><code id="ct">#include <iostream></code> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as <code id="ct">cout</code> (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.</li>
		<li><code id="ct">using namespace std</code> means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.</li>
		<li>A blank line. C++ ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.</li>
		<li>Another thing that always appear in a C++ program, is <code id="ct">int main()</code>. This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets <code id="ct">{}</code> will be executed.</li>
		<li><code id="ct">cout</code> (pronounced "see-out") is an object used together with the insertion operator (<code id="ct"><<</code>) to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World".</li>
		<li><code id="ct">return 0</code> ends the main function.
		<li>Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket <code id="ct">}</code> to actually end the main function.
	</ol>
<h2>Other Notes:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon ;.</li>
		<li>The body of <code id="ct">int main()</code> could also been written as:<br>
		<code id="kw">int</code> <code>main () {</code> <code id="kw">cout</code> <code><< "Hello World! ";</code> <code id="kw"> return 0;</code> <code> }</code></li>
		<li>The compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.</li>
		<li>It is up to you if you want to include the standard namespace library or not.</li>
	</ul>
