# Site_build_2
Another page I have built for myself to using W3 CSS

**Situation:** I had an idea to create a more interactive way to showcase my skills as a web developer.

**Mission:** Create a page that would interact with the viewers and show my skills as a developer.

**My thoughts:**
I created this page using a template from w3schools.com using W3 CSS. 

I made this page as a introudction to myself showing my skills from my resume. The goal is to show a paper copy resume, this page with links to my other pages to kinda show off my skills and what I can do.

Please keep in mind I am a new developer and and feedback you can give would be greatly appreiciated.
