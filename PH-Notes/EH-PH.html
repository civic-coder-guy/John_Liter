A computer hacker is a skilled expert who overcomes a problem using their technical knowledge.
the term “hacker” is used mostly with computer security issues.
relates to exploiting the weaknesses of a computer system by employing one’s technical knowledge.

Understanding data
Data is nothing but plain facts
Data without any context is useless for anybody.
Each piece of data should convey some form of information.

Information
Pieces of data when stitched together conveys information.
It is this piece that a hacker aims to extract.
Getting hold of a random file is of no importance unless we know if it contains Confidential or Non-confidential information.
data stored in a digital format becomes of utmost importance for a hacker.

Basic Concept of Hacking
Hacking is all about extracting information.
Hackers try to destabilize a system by using it in ways that weren’t intended by its creators.
Hackers try to destabilize a system by using it in ways that weren’t intended by its creators.

Vulnerability
In computer systems, a vulnerability is a flaw within the system.
This flaw leaves it exposed and hence more prone to attacks.
Threat
This refers to anything that can cause potential harm to a system.
Both, vulnerability and threat, have the potential to harm a system.
a vulnerability is something that can be fixed.
A threat can be environmental as well as man-made.
Environmental Threats are nothing but fierce weather conditions or natural disasters.
Man-made threat is damage to a system or organization caused by a person with different motives.
It can be a disgruntled employee within an organization or a spy from another country.
The former is known as Internal Threat whereas the latter is called External Threat.
Internal Threat is more likely to happen as employees have higher visibility to confidential information.
each organisation employs stringent set of rules and regulations to deter any such threat from its own people.
These rules can be simply marking your email as “Sensitive” or “Non-Sensitive”.
These rules can be simply marking your email as “Sensitive” or “Non-Sensitive”.

Vulnerabilities in Computers
Data & Information.
By leaving the systems unlocked, an employee lets important information vulnerable.
An entire climax of the war was dependent on how secure was their data.
In this digital age, billions of dollars are at stake because of data security.

Describing Motivations
In broad terms, a hacker’s motivation can be divided into following 3 categories:

Political
Hackers attacking a particular system to support a political cause are driven by political motivation.
These attacks are normally non-violent in nature
This means that there is no victimisation rather a message is sent across.
Many people term this form of attacks as Cyber Terrorism.
Since these attacks also render lots of website services as useles, regular users of a particular website are not available to access it because such attacks bring down the websites.

Economical
this type of motivation is fuelled by the greed for money.
the hacker installs a Malware on the victim’s system.
This malware, piece of computer code, locks down the entire system.
In order to unlock it, the victim is asked to pay a ransom.
This type of malware is also known as Ransomware.
Within the internet community, this type of attack is called Cyber Espionage.

Personal
Harassing a person via digital means is termed as Cyber Stalking.
It is super easy these days to stalk someone using their social media accounts.
An attacker can go through the victim’s online feeds to understand their lifestyle.
With the live check-in features of websites like Facebook, a victim’s whereabouts can be easily understood.
The worst part of this attack is that the victim hardly knows whether they are being stalked by someone.
The most destructive piece of cyber stalking is hacking into someone’s webcam.
With this, the hacker has personal information of the victim which in turn is used to harass them.
One should always be vigilant of who they are interacting with on social media websites.

Black Hat
This type of a hacker is known as a Black Hat Hacker.
With this, they are able to earn a bounty in forms of ransom or fame.
They exploit the vulnerabilities for their own benefit.
it seems that they are completely against the system.
Black Hat Hackers are mostly involved in Cyber Espionage.
This allows them to illegally enter systems, steal data and reportedly sell the same for an hefty amount.

White Hat
The guy who wears white is normally associated with something good.
White Hat Hackers are people who are employed by the system itself.
They are given all the rights by the owners of a system to bring it down.
This way, the owners understand the weaknesses of their system.
A very important trait is that a White Hat Hacker never uses his/her knowledge for malicious purposes.
Each fault or a loophole is reported back so that the system can be improved further.
In other words, they are security specialists employed by companies.
Each flaw detected earns them some bounty.

Look into Google Security Princess

Grey Hat
Grey Hat Hackers work somewhere in the middle of the two previously explained categories.
A hacker can sometimes exhibit the traits of both, black and white hats.
Let’s say a White Hat Hacker who has identified a flaw in the system uses it against the system itself.
This type of Hacker is known as a Grey Hat Hacker.
Some texts suggest that a Grey Hatter finds a loophole in a system without obtaining the permission of the system owners.
He or she then asks for a bounty for their findings.
If not delivered, they make this information available for public use.

Malware
is a piece of computer code.The sub-text “Mal” refers to “malicious”.
This piece of code’s behaviour highlights its malicious nature.
A Malware can be used to:
Disrupt normal working of a computer system.
Gather sensitive information from a disk/drive.
Display unwanted ads.
Access illegally private computer systems.

Malware Classification
A Malware can be classified as User Mode Malware or Kernel Mode Malware.
Kernel is the heart of an operating system.
Each process in an OS functions at a certain privilege level.
What we see on our screens is the outermost layer, which has the least privileges.
Kernel sits inside the innermost ring and has the highest privilege.
The rings in between are nothing but drivers of a particular application.
Their job is nothing but to pass messages from Kernel Ring to the User Mode Ring
When a malware affects the Kernel Program of an application, the communication between these rings is hampered.
In this way, even if the file you want to open is completely fine, the kernel application doesn’t allow this.
When the kernel program is affected, all the files of that application becomes unreadable.
User mode Malware: Alternatively, when a malware affects the User Level of an application, the communication is broken only for that particular infected file.
This way, you can create a new file or work on some other non-infected files.
Hitting the kernel program of an application is tougher and more devastating one.

Categories of Malware
Computer Virus
WORM
Trojan Horse
With the advent of newer technologies, many new categories of Malware have been created.
Adware, Spyware, Bloatware, and many other new names have cropped up

Virus
Many texts suggest that the word Virus is an acronym.Vital Information Resource Under Siege
This code, once executed, starts performing tasks in the background.

Some viruses will use up all the computing power to perform a job.
It can be a simple job of pinging “google.com” for no apparent reason.
Due to this, the victim’s machine performs very slow as majority of its resources are being used by the Virus.
A Virus’ damage increases as it spreads to other disks and drives.
However, it always needs to attach itself to a host file or an application to spread.
Not just the storage areas inside the system, a Virus propagates to portable drives like USB Sticks.
three main components of Virus. These are:
Concealer - 
The concealer's job is to make Virus appear as a benign application i.e a trust-worthy and genuine application.
This part is normally done by the attacker during the creation of the virus itself.
A simple way is to show another app’s icon as its own.
This way the victim is fooled to believe that it is a trust-worthy file.

Payload
The Payload is nothing but the actual piece of code where the instructions are stated.
This decides the behaviour of the virus.
It can be a simple command of restarting the machine indefinitely.

Replicator - Can be applied to networks.

Virus Life Cycle:
The phases of this includes:
Dormant - 
A virus can remain dormant in its initial stage.
In this phase, it just exists within a system.
Not all viruses will have this phase.

Propagation
In this stage, it tries to copy itself to other group of files or an application.
So that when a user migrates these infected files or application, the virus can also travel.

Triggering
Now, the Virus is existing on multiple systems.
But it is still dormant as no execution has happened yet.
Trigger phase becomes the starting point of execution of the virus.
Normally, triggers are kept at a certain date/time.
Once the system date/time is equal to the one virus is scheduled to execute, mayhem occurs.
Remember, by this stage, the virus has tried its best to propagate itself to multiple systems.

Execution

Worms
Just like Virus, some texts suggest that a Worm is also an acronym.
It stands for “Write Once, Read Multiple”
However, a Worm is capable of self-replicating itself.
Hence the full form, Write Once but Read multiple times.
This shows the behavioural aspect of a Worm.
Both Viruses and Worms are capable of inflicting the same kind of damage.
But a Worm can be termed as more nasty than the Virus.
It doesn’t need the help of a human or a host program to propagate.

Worms are standalone pieces of software code that try propagation on its own.
These codes look for some known vulnerability of systems that can facilitate spreading of malwares.
Usual place is the stored email addresses on a machine.

History
The name of this Malware comes from an ancient story of a battle between the Greeks and the people of Troy.
Greeks sent a huge wooden horse as a gift to Troy.
However, inside this wooden horse, Greek Soldiers were waiting to attack
People of Troy accepted this shiny gift only to find themselves caught in the onslaught of Greeks.

Trojan Horse -This Malware gets its name from that same wooden horse.
Trojan Horse is a malicious piece of code that looks legitimate to the victims.
However, it can inflict similar damage as to what Viruses and Worms can achieve.

The difference with Trojans is that it neither attaches itself to a host program nor does it self-replicate.
It requires user interaction to be executed.
A user is likely to receive a trojan file in an email attachment which once opened, starts its execution phase.

Love Bug
This Malware is received as an email with an attachment called LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs
Once saved on the system, a user could view the filename as LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT
The last part, .vbs, which defines the file type being a Visual Basic Script was hidden in that era’s Windows System.
This file extension was hidden because .vbs file type was interpreted by Windows OS as a known file type.
Therefore all the known file types’ extension was hidden by default
Concealed - A user would look at the file and think it to be a benign .TXT file. And therefore, the likelihood of opening this malware was very high.
Once opened, the VB Script gets activated and this Malware attains the execution phase.
ILOVEYOU then overwrites a lot of existing files, resulting in huge damages to the system owner.
However, the most deadly bit of this malware was its propagation mechanism.
It copied all the e-mail addresses from the Windows Address Book which was used by Microsoft Outlook.
The malware then forwards the infected e-mail to all the copied addresses.
The receiver of these emails would see that this email is sent by a known person rather than the originating attacker’s email id.
This way, within minutes, thousands of e-mails started proliferating which resulted in the complete shutdown of Mail Servers.
This attack was estimated to have caused US$5-8 billion in damages worldwide.
Over 50 million infections were reported in 10 days
The damage was quantified as the time and effort spent in removing the infection and recovering files from backup.

Fixing on a Target
Before launching any attack, it is important to fix on a target.
A target can be an individual or a complete organization.
Once that is done, we can move to the stage called Reconnaissance.
	In military terms, this means to obtain information about the enemy's territory using some or the other visuals.
	Reconnaissance is done to obtain information about our target.

Active and Passive
This gathering of information can be done using:
Passive Methods - include anything that doesn’t involve direct interaction with your target.
	This means gathering information via Social Channels, News Channels, Research Papers and so on.
	It includes everything that is available as open source.

Active Methods
Active Methods include anything that involves direct interaction with your target.
It could be as simple as talking with your individual target and extracting information.
In other ways, a Hacker can break into the Private Network of an organization as well.
	here is one major issue with both these methods mentioned above.
	An attacker is supposed to remain unidentified by its target.
	It’s not necessary, however, we all love a bit of Cat N Mouse chase in our lives.

Identity at stake
The information gathering leaves one vulnerable as their identities can be easily tracked.
This is possible because of IP Addresses.
An IP Address is the address from where a message originates on a network.
It is with these addresses that any system is identified in a network.

Mask Identity
Since both the methods requires the attacker to be connected to a network, the IP Address gets compromised.
This problem advocates the need for masking identity.

Proxy Servers can help with this.
	Proxy Servers are used as an intermediary between an attacker and the target.
	An attacker accesses the target’s information via these proxies.
	The target will always think that this attack was originated by the Proxy Server.
	The process of creating connection between the attacker’s system and the Proxy Server is called Tunnelling.
	Tunnelling helps in creating a private channel over a public network like Internet.
	There are many tunnelling protocols like SSH, HTTP, etc.

Profiling
It makes you understand a thing or two about your target.
The best way to go about this is extracting information from their Social Profiles.
It can give you vital information like Email Id, Date of Birth, Address, etc.
This way a personalized attack can be performed using the above information.

Career Profiling
It gives you access to hundreds of employee names which in turn give more records of vital information.
These new names and email ids generate newer targets at an exponential rate.

Harvesting
The method explained to obtain information is also termed as Email Address Harvesting.
With this, a major attack can be triggered.
Tonnes of targets reciprocates into more damage.

System Hacking
	Pre-Attack
		The most complex bit lies in performing the actual hack.
	Categories of Password Attacks
		There are two main categories in cracking passwords:
		Non-Technical Password Attack
			Dumpster Diving-
			As the name suggests, it actually means looking for information from a bin.
			People nowadays have way too many passwords to remember.
			And the simplest way to keep a track of these is to write it down.
			An attacker using this method is behind those valuable pieces of paper,
			Or old notepad files where passwords were once written down.
			Sometimes you may find other information like user id as well.
			That Recycle Bin is actually a Goldmine.

		Technical Password Attack
		He or she will need some technical measures and we shall discuss the same as following:
			Password Guessing & Automated Password Guessing
				With this information, an Attacker guesses the password of the authentication system.
				A list of possible passwords are noted in a document first.
				A looping code is written such that the system prompts for the part where password is required after each unsuccessful attempt.
				The code will pick each entry from the list of possible passwords and keep checking until a match is found.
				This same technique of listing possible passwords can be extended to listing of possible usernames as well, if required.
		
			Password Sniffing
				A large part of traffic passes through a network everyday which may not be encrypted.
				This means that the password you just typed into the login page of a website travelled as it is on the network.
				An attacker, monitoring the network, with some tools like Pass-The-Hash or Wireshark can easily sniff your password in such a case.
				
			Keystroke Loggers
				If this is present on your system, it means every key pressed by you has been recorded by these hacking tools.
				This in turn means that at some point the password was also pressed and the attacker already has it in clear-text form. No need of reverse hashing or decryption.
				Keystroke Loggers can be in hardware or software form.
				In our workplaces, we hardly check for any susceptible devices attached to our computer.
				The hardware piece, which looks like a USB/keyboard cable, can have WiFi functionality as well.
				With this, all detected keystrokes are accessed by the attacker wirelessly.
				

		Social Engineering - 
		In this method, an attacker tries to get the password directly from the target.
		Credit Card Frauds usually takes place with the help of Social Engineering.
		
		Shoulder Surfing
		people sit too close to each other.
		Attacker’s creepiness level goes too high in this case.
		They are always on the lookout of valuable information being typed or viewed.

		Monitoring the Network
		Such tools record each packet that traverses in a network.
		With proper monitoring, an attacker can identify the packet that is transporting your password.
		Only problem that arises with this method is when passwords are encrypted and then sent in a packet.
		
		Reverse Hash
		However, attackers now boast of Reverse Hash tools that can generate back the passwords for them.
		One important bit is that to perform this kind of an attack, the hacker must have some amount of access to either the system itself or the network.
		Without this, the monitoring of network packets won’t be possible.
		

///////
The advent of the internet made our lives easier.
Communication is now happening at lightning speed.
Transactions related to money and data are quite common nowadays.
With this, came a plethora of data being available for everyone.
Whether it is for use or misuse is something that we shall be talking about.
Today everything works via a Login Screen.
One should take great care of their online data than anything else.
With the proliferation of Social Media websites, a large number of web hacks have also come in limelight.
Along with these, the Internet Banking and Online Shopping provides their own issues.

Phishing
Phishing is one of the most common web-based attack.
It happens at the client-side and hence the person solely responsible is the innocent victim himself/herself.
Phishing is the act of making a web page appear as authentic as possible.
The naive users will interact with a phished website only to divulge all their details very cheaply.
Often people have zero idea of interacting with such a malicious application.
This is because a phished website in nothing but an exact replica of the actual website.
	Let’s assume your Gmail Login page has to be phished.
	The attacker will initially save the entire html page of Gmail Login Screen.
	This can be easily done by just Right Click + Save the Page.
	Now, the attacker who is having its own server, would host this Login Screen page.
	He would generate a link to this page and send it to the victim.
	Making the victim open this phished page can be a task.
	
	Phishing Links
	To achieve this, the attacker can use many things that we have discussed till now.
	He can send the phished link via e-mail such that it looks like it has originated from Gmail itself.
	Now, once the Target opens up this link, he would be viewing the phished Gmail Login Page.
	Since this page looks exactly the same as actual Gmail page, the target is bound to type his credentials and hit “Enter”.
		Talking a little off-topic, whenever we are interacting with actual Gmail Login page, our creds go to Gmail server which are authenticated and hence we get access.
		But with a Phished website, there won’t be any such connection.
	In order to make this work, an attacker uses a small script which runs on a Phished Website as soon as the target hits “Enter”.

	Million Dollor Script
	Firstly, it will note down the username and password entered and store it on the attacker’s server.
	Secondly, it shall redirect the target to the authentic website.
	This way, the target is persuaded to believe that a simple page refresh happened and hence I have to provide my creds again.
	Now, the target is simply interacting with the actual Gmail Website and hence things are bound to go smoothly.
	Whereas, the attacker now holds the valid credentials of the target.
	
Client-side vs Server side
Phishing is a client-side attack.
The data being compromised is of a user who is the client in a client-server architecture.
But there are many other attacks that can happen server-side as well.
A server-side attack is where the sender of information is compromised. In every case, it is the server.
It can be a database of server or its resources.

SQL Injection
It is a bit technical in nature and hence I will try to make you understand it as much as possible.
Targeted Information - This extra information can be:
	All products the website holds
	Usernames & Passwords
	Credit Card Information

Post this, a lot of queries are executed to understand:
Type of Database
Table Names
Column Names
Only after this, the attacker can extract any valuable information from the server.

So an attacker can place something like this in the search box:
 Shirts’ UNION (SELECT col_Login, col_Hash FROM table_Users);--
This should provide a result of all user ids and their respective passwords.
